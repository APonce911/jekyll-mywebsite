<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
Hi! My name is Airton Ponce, I'm 28, economist graduated from Insper and Alumni Le Wagon Brasil. I have worked at Santander Asset Management for 6 years as a portfolio manager, and as a tech lover, decided to learn coding!
</p>

<h2>The Blog</h2>
<p>
During my career in the financial market I was responsible for several texts produced by the investments desk, and these turned publications of the Bank to its clients and prospects. In addition, I wrote daily texts with my opinions on the markets as a way to guide my investment decisions, but I could not publish them, and I kept them in a personal Excel worksheet.
</p>
<p>
Today, a few years later, I realize the value of those texts, and how much I could have helped others by sharing my opinions and learnings. This is an attempt to contribute to the community in my new journey in the universe of programming, technology and entrepreneurship.
</p>

<p>
So I would like to reformulate:
<strike>Happiness</strike> Knowledge is only real when shared.
