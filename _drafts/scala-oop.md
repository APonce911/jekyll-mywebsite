<h3>Class Parameters <> Class Fields </h3>

Class arguments cannot be assessed outside theinstance, to do that, you need a class field.
To convert a class parameter to a class field, use val on the constructor.

<h3>Methods Overloading</h3>  

Overloading means same method name, but different signature.
Signature means number of aparameters, or parameters with different types. It can result a different return type for the function, but it is not necessary to define overloading.

<h3>Auxiliary constructors</h3>

Is a method overloading for the parent method, implemented with different signature.
Auxiliary constructors can be exchanged by default values on the class constructor
