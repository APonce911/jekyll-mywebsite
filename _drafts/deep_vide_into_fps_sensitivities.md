One of my main hobbies is gaming. In this post, I tell you a little bit of how I got into pc gaming and my discoveries on it. I've had a hard time trying to keep up and play on the same level against average lobby, I here I will post some of my learnings.

I don't know how many of you know, but I'm really a gaming enthusiast and collector. I started playing video games on my old SNES when I was 4, and after that, I had only a few small breaks. Recently I've just built my first PC. I couldn't tolerate being a software developer and had never touched a PC part.

To get into PC gaming I filled all my SSD memory with shooter games. I've Installed CS:GO, Fortnite, Arma 3 and PUBG. Yes, it's a lot.

My first problem was that I was a Potato (aka Noob). The second one was that I was playing too many games, and it was hard to get used to then all at the same time. That's why some people only focus on playing a single shooter at a time, but I wouldn't do that...

I couldn't understand why the feel was so different to play some games, and how some people could handle those differences well and others didn't. So I started digging.

Besides an infinity of aspects of those games, one single functionality hook me the most. Aiming.

The first thing you need to adjust when jumping into a game is how your aim works. Keybinds, physical setup, hardware, software, all of that can help you, but without the proper aim, you will struggle a LOT on those types of games.

But, how to adjust?

That's a good question, and today, the answer could worth some millions of dollars if you play competitively ...

But if you're reading this, I assume you're not a pro, and just like me would like to get better, or git gud ;). For the casual/tryhard, I think this post might help achiving that.

To properly adjust your aim, those are the things you will have to be aware of :

What is sensitivity?
Mouse DPI/PPI
Ingame sensitivity
Mouse acceleration
Free aim/ads/scoped sensitivities
Metrics of mouse sensitivities
Normalizing sensitivities  and
How games works(Advanced)
and finally, a good way to adjust.


What is sensitivity?
That's simple, and Its not specific of PC gaming.

It's basically the amount of in-game camera/crosshair/scope movement you get per a determined mouse movement.

Some games have different methodologies on stablishing the specific number, but you will later on be able to compare then all on a single rule.

Mouse DPI/PPI

Ingame sensitivity

Mouse acceleration

Free aim/ads/scoped sensitivities

Metrics of mouse sensitivities

Normalizing sensitivities
cm/360 metric.
Monitor distance metric.
